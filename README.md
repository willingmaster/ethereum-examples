##Provable Ethereum

```
    contract YourSmartContract is usingProvable {
        // â€¦ 
    }
```

This provisions your contract with the __`provable_query()`__ function (and many others!), which makes it trivial to leverage our technology straight away. Head into the __`Solidity`__ directory for more information.

:computer: Happy developing!

### __Serpent__

:skull: __CAUTION__: It is highly recommended to avoid using Serpent, especially in production. The examples herein have been left for reasons of posterity but support for it is no longer maintained as Serpent is considered outdated and audits have shown it to be flawed. Use them at your own risk!
